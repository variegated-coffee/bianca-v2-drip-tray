# bianca-v2-drip-tray
Design files for a load cell drip tray grate for the Lelit Bianca V2. It is possible (probable even) that the same design would work on the Lelit Bianca V1, as well as the stainless steel version of the Lelit Bianca V3.

Other than looking cool, the purpose of the design is to be able to fit load cells, making the drip tray grate a weighing platform. These load cells can then be hooked up to the [Gravity](https://github.com/variegated-coffee/gravity) scale controller, allowing for integration with the rest of your machine, or a display, or whatever you want to do.

## Manufacturing
I've tried providing manufacturing files in a couple of different formats. If you just want to send the design off to manufacturing, the STEP file should be all you need. It's designed to be cut from a single sheet of 2 mm sheet metal, and then bent. The STEP file is 3D. I've also uploaded the F3D file (as I've used Fusion 360 to design the grate).
